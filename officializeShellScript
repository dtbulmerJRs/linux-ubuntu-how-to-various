Do you want a shell script to run in terminal like:
  MYSCRIPTNAME  <args>
  
instead of cd'ing to the directory and running it there?

well all you have to do is copy the script over to your usr/bin directory

first change the permissions to be writable by all
chmod +w myscript.sh

you have some options as what to do:
A.
sudo install myscript.sh /usr/local/bin/MYSCRIPTNAME

B.
sudo cp myscript.sh /usr/bin/.

Note that the location /usr/bin is prefered by myself, because it is more accessable than 
/usr/local/bin (meaning all users can use it).  The local directory makes it run for the 
current user only.
