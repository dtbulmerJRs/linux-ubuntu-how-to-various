Completely removing Wine: In case you want to completely remove Wine, the ususal uninstall 
command would leave you wondering what went wrong. It will uninstall Wine but leave the 
folders under the Applications menu. If you want a complete uninstall, execute the 
following commands in Terminal in the following order.

sudo apt-get remove wine
rm -rf $HOME/.wine
rm -f $HOME/.config/menus/applications-merged/wine*
rm -rf $HOME/.local/share/applications/wine
rm -f $HOME/.local/share/desktop-directories/wine*
rm -f $HOME/.local/share/icons/????_*.xpm

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These commands are to be entered into the Terminal to give Ubuntu more features.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are software packages that I have evaluated and installed in my Ubuntu Computers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.gtk-recordMyDesktop (lets you record a screen cast of your desktop - ..ogv format only)
I recommand chaning your audio to 11025 Hz under the advanced tab. Plus, change 10fps underneath the 
Performance tab. The other settings should be fine. You will need to use DeVeDe (AVI-MP4 option to convert it) 
and use Avidemux to edit the video file (save under Auto settings to FLV)

2.Rhythmbox Music Player - You can Sync your IPOD with this and other Audio USB players.It can import your music 
folders and even change your music files to the OGG format. Rhythmbox can even your other audio files. You will 
need to install WinFF to convert strange audio formats that RhythomBox can play.

3.Cheese Web Cam Booth - (lets you record video/pictures with your webcam - ogv format only) 
This does not work within Gtk-recordmydesktop.

4.GuvcView web cam software and photo taker. Lots of Video formats. Works within Gtk-recordmydesktop and Kazam.

5.TeamViewer - is a great for working on your friends computer that is in another city, state, or country.
It allows you the ability to access anyone's computer that also has teamviewer installed. You will be given
an unique ID and either a Dynamic Password or a Personal Password for access to those computers.

6.Kdenlive (equalivant to windows movie maker) Takes a long time to RENDER the projects. Great green screen options.

7.Audacity (record sound into multiple formats and import/export functions). Can be used home recording studio.

8.DeVEDe (great at converting OGV to AVI format + Pick Divx/Mpeg4 + add + adv. Options + Choose Default Format: NTSC)

9.WinFF (great for coverting everything to one single format except has issues with OGV video
Use DeVeDe first for the OGV video formats

10.Open Office

11.GTK Wiimote Whiteboard Software

12.Take ScreenShot - Now simple just press the print screen button.

13.Edubuntu Add-On (great for teachers/students)

14.Gimp Image Editior (great can be complicated and will even import PDF files). Great for your Wacom Bamboo Connect.

15.GNU Paint (very simple)

16.KolourPaint (very simple as well...great for Gtk-recordmydesktop with your screencaptures)

17.Inkscape (great vector image software)

18.Filezilla (Ftp server software)

19.PDFsam (great to combine different pdf's together)

20.K9copy (to back up your Personal DVD collection). I recommand using the K9copyassistant for DVD copying.
Make sure under your SETTINGS for the DVD icon....Does not have any check marks on BURNING section.
If you do not....all of your burning options will fail....Unless you have the KDE enviroment.


21.pyKaraoke (if you like karaoke)

22.WINE (to run some Windows based software...for things you must have on Linux)

23.APTonCD (lets you download all software, programs, and updates you have already installed 
on your favorite pc's onto several others...
or just lets you restore your lost Applications and settings from a fresh start)

--------BELOW - YOU WILL FIND ALL THE TERMINAL COMMANDS FOR THIS - WITH THEIR EXPLANATIONS -----
cd /var/cache/apt/archives (this command finds where the APT packages were loaded)

sudo dpkg -i *.deb (this command will finally install the software)

If not all of your programs are showing up then do this.....(takes a few hours)
$ sudo apt-get install dpkg-repack fakeroot
$ mkdir ~/dpkg-repack; cd ~/dpkg-repack
$ fakeroot -u dpkg-repack `dpkg --get-selections | grep install | cut -f1`
sudo dpkg -i *.deb (to install these packages)
------------------------------This ENDS the COMMANDS for APTonCD------------------------------------

24. TiLEM is a great TI-83+ emulator. You will need your calculator's ROM to use it.
Roms are available here: http://web.tiscali.it/magazzinocartoniani/

25. TiEMU is a great TI89 emulator. You will need your calculator's Rom to use it.
Roms are available here: http://web.tiscali.it/magazzinocartoniani/

26. Qcad is a great free simple CAD program. Saves and opens only DXF formats.

27. FreeCAD is an OK CAD program. Can view 2D and 3D images. I do not like it.

28. SagCAD is horrible CAD program.

29. PyCAD is a CAD program that I never liked as well.

30. SeaMonkey is a great web browser and Webpage design Suite. Plus you can use it with your email as well. 
This is a must have!!!!

31. FireFox is my greatest browser.

32. Skype is a must have as well.

33. Empathy IM Client is great if you need all your social media accounts on one IM system.

34. TUXmath is great if you have a elementry, middle, high school kid struggling in basic math.

35. VirtualBox OSE is great if you have to ever have Windows XP/Vista/7 installed on your Linux Machine.
This is better than having a dual boot machine or running Linux inside of Windows. Boot Sectors 
are never messed with this software. You will need to install the Meta-Package for USB support. I got it 
from the Vitual Box website. Once the package is installed you will need to assign your user/groups
permissions to allow VirtualBox to use the USB ports. We will need to give USB support to oursleves 
and other groups. Below is the process to do this by adding USB filters.

USB filters are needed for our USB devices and will be sent to the guest OS. From the main Virtualbox window, 
open the Settings dialog, then the USB section, then click the little "add filter" button on the right side 
of the screen. You should be able to create a filter from any currently connected USB devices.After you've done 
this (maybe restart to be sure the host OS isn't capturing any of the USB devices for itself. Ubuntu will 
try to automount the flash drive so you might also want to check and make sure that it is unmounted too) 
then boot into the guest OS and you should see your USB devices. Next, I had the same problem and fixed 
it by clicking in the VirtualBox group of my user. You can access it installing gnome-system-tools 
(it does not come with Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin), either via the Ubuntu Software Center, Synaptic 
or by typing in the terminal:(sudo apt-get install gnome-system-tools) Remember that to paste in the 
terminal you have to use CTRL+SHIFT+C or use the right click option on your mouse. You will probably 
have to enter your password to allow the installation and add a Y (as in yes) to finish installing the 
packages.Then you head to your Dash home and type users. You will see two applications. The good one is 
Users and Groups. You then have to click on Advanced settings for your user and enter your password.
Now you will be shown a window with three tabs. Click on User Privileges. Find the line that says Use 
Virtualbox virtualization solution and then OK. Change user group privileges

Also, if you are looking to print with inside of VirtualBox Windows XP
then you will have to change a setting in VirtualBox. I had to change the connection type from NAT to Bridge
Connection. This is under DEVICES-NETWORK ADAPTERS - (attached to field). This is how I got my shared
network printer to print since it was set up on a WindowsXP machine. After that, just find your Network printer 
and install the proper printer driver.

336.Bamboo Connect CTL470 - This is  how you get it to work on Ubuntu 12.04LTS. I never could figure out how
to get it to work on Ubuntu 10.04LTS.

terminal codes
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:lekensteyn/wacom-tablet
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install wacom-dkms

37. Gmount-ISO  is a great if you ever need to mount or install using an ISO file.

38. Flaming mouse pointer. Install (compiz-fusion-plugins-extra) and (CCompizconfig Settings Manager) from the
Ubuntu Software Center...... Now go to System > Preferences > Compizconfig settings manager.....Locate (Show Mouse)
Set the mouse's general mouse settings to their lost values of (0.1000,10,1)

39. How to restore your panel in Ubuntu 10.04
$ gconftool-2 --shutdown
$ rm -rf ~/.gconf/apps/panel
$ pkill gnome-panel



40.LTSP is used for setting up thin-client PCs in a school or office setting. 
Here are the settings to setup an LTSP
sudo apt-get install ltsp-server-standalone openssh-server

(have to have root access to change settings)
(to setup root password ---- sudo passwd root)

(install vim)
aptitude install vim-nox

(edit the dhcpd.conf with gedit)
sudo vim /etc/ltsp/dhcpd.conf

use these values
subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0
range 192.168.0.100 192.168.0.254
domain name - username
DNS - 11.111.11.111 
broadcast 192.168.0.254

Instructions for installing tilp and getting it to work with the TI-84+:

1) Install the tilp package and its dependencies like libticables2-2: sudo apt-get install tilp

2) Download the patch:
wget https://launchpadlibrarian.net/79510370/new-devices-and-fixed-sysfs-warning.patch

3) Apply the patch to the installed udev rules:
sudo patch /lib/udev/rules.d/45-libticables.rules < new-devices-and-fixed-sysfs-warning.patch 

4) Add yourself to the tilp group:
sudo usermod -a -G tilp $USER

5) Re-login to apply the group settings (Restart Computer)

6) The TI-84+ uses an USB-A - USB-B connector which is called DirectLink. This should be detected automatically. 
Connect the calculator now to the computer. If you've previously had connected it already, disconnect and reconnect it.
7) Now make known to tilp that you're using a TI-84+ calculator by running:
tilp --calc=ti84+ --cable=DirectLink

This will set the calc=TI84+ and cable_model=DirectLink in the ~/.tilp configuration file. After running the above command, it's sufficient to run just tilp in the future (using the application menu or by running the command directly).
